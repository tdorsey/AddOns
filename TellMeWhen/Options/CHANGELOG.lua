[==[* Fixed the missing slider value text for the Unit Level condition.]==],
[==[* The Haste conditions no longer have a hard cap of 100%.]==],
[==[* Fixed a false error that would display during configuring while using the [Range] DogTag.]==],
[==[* Fixed an error relating to refreshing the tooltip for non-button widgets.]==],
[==[]==],
[==[===v7.0.1===]==],
[==[* Numbered units entered with a space in the middle (e.g. "arena 1") will once again be corrected by TellMeWhen. It is still bad practice to enter units like that, though.]==],
[==[]==],
[==[====Bug Fixes====]==],
[==[* Fixed a typo that was preventing Loss of Control icons from reporting their spell.]==],
[==[* Fixed an error that would happen when upgrading a text layout that was previously unnamed: IconModule_TextsTexts.lua:150 attempt to concatenate field 'Name' (a nil value)]==],
[==[]==],
[==[===v7.0.0===]==],
[==[]==],
[==[====Core Systems====]==],
[==[* You can now create global groups that exist for all characters on your account. These groups can be enabled and disabled on a per-profile basis.]==],
[==[* Text Layouts are now defined on an account-wide basis instead of being defined for individual profiles.]==],
[==[]==],
[==[* Many icon types, when set on the first icon in a group, are now able to control that entire group with the data that they harvest.]==],
[==[]==],
[==[* All references from one icon or group to another in TellMeWhen are now tracked by a unique ID. This ID will persist no matter where it is moved or exported to.]==],
[==[** This includes:]==],
[==[*** DogTags]==],
[==[*** Meta icons]==],
[==[*** Icon Shown conditions (and the other conditions that track icons)]==],
[==[*** Group anchoring to other groups]==],
[==[** The consequence of this is that you can now, for example, import/export a meta icon separately from the icons it is checking and they will automatically find eachother once they are all imported (as long as these export strings were created with TMW v7.0.0+)]==],
[==[** IMPORTANT: Existing DogTags that reference other icons/groups by ID cannot be updated automatically - you will need to change these yourself.]==],
[==[]==],
[==[====Events/Notifications====]==],

[==[* Combat Event: the unit exclusion "Miscellaneous: Unknown Unit" will now also cause events that were fired without a unit to be excluded.]==],
[==[* Meta Icon: The "Inherit failed condition opacity" setting has been removed. Meta icons will now always inherit the exact opacity of the icons they are showing, though this can be overridden by the meta icon's opacity settings.]==],

[==[* Diminishing Returns: The duration of Diminishing Returns is now customizable in TMW's main options.]==],

[==[* Buff/Debuff: Added an [AuraSource] DogTag to obtain the unit that applied a buff/debuff, if available.]==],
[==[* Buff/Debuff Check: Removed the "Hide if no units" option since it didn't make much sense for this icon type.]==],
[==[]==],
[==[====Conditions====]==],
[==[* New Conditions added that offer integration with Big Wigs and Deadly Boss Mods.]==],
[==[* New Condition: Specialization Role]==],

[==[====Group Modules====]==],
[==[* You can now anchor groups to the cursor.]==],
[==[* You can now right-click-and-drag the group resize handle to easily change the number of rows and columns of a group, and doing so with this method will preserve the relative positions of icons within a group.]==],
[==[* Added group settings that allow you to specify when a group should be shown based on the role that your current specialization fulfills.]==],
[==[]==],
[==[====Icon Modules====]==],
[==[* You can now enter "none" or "blank" as a custom texture for an icon to force it to display no texture.]==],

[==[]==],
[==[* New text layout settings: Width, Height, & JustifyV.]==],
[==[]==],
[==[====Miscellaneous====]==],
[==[* The group settings tab in the Icon Editor now only displays the group options for the currently loaded icon's group by default. This can be changed back to the old behavior with a checkbox in the top-left corner of the tab in the Icon Editor.]==],
[==[]==],
[==[* Exporting a meta icon will also export the string(s) of its component icons.]==],
[==[* Exporting groups and icons will also export the string(s) of their text layouts.]==],
[==[]==],

[==[* New buff equivalency: SpeedBoosts]==],
[==[]==],
[==[* Code snippets can now be disabled from autorunning at login.]==],

[==[]==],
[==[* TellMeWhen_Options now maintains a backup of TellMeWhen's SavedVariables that will be restored if TellMeWhen's SVs become corrupted.]==],
[==[]==],
[==[* TellMeWhen no longer includes the massively incomplete localizations for itIT, ptBR, frFR, deDE, koKR, and esMX (esMX now uses esES). If you would like to contribute to localization, go to http://wow.curseforge.com/addons/tellmewhen/localization/]==],
[==[]==],
[==[====Bug Fixes====]==],
[==[* Units tracked by name with spaces in them (E.g. Kor'kron Warbringer as a CLEU unit filter) will now be interpreted properly as input.]==],
[==[** IMPORTANT: A consequence of this fix is that if you are enter a unit like "boss 1", this will no longer work. You need to enter "boss1", which has always been the proper unitID.]==],

[==[* Icons should now always have the correct size after their view changes or the size or ID of a group changes.]==],
[==[* Fixed an issue where strings imported from older version of TellMeWhen (roughly pre-v6.0.0) could have their StackMin/Max and DurationMin/Max settings as strings instead of numbers.]==],
[==[* The "Equipment set equipped" condition should properly update when saving the equipment set that is currently equipped.]==],

[==[* Currency conditions should once again be listed in the condition type selection menu.]==],
[==[* The NPC ID condition should now work correctly with npcIDs that are greater than 65535 (0xFFFF).]==],
[==[* Meta icons should reflect changes in the icons that they are checking that are caused by using slash commands to enable/disable icons while TMW is locked.]==],
[==[* TellMeWhen no longer registers PLAYER_TALENT_UPDATE - there is a Blizzard big causing this to fire at random for warlocks, and possibly other classes as well, which triggers a TMW:Update() which can cause a sudden framerate drop. PLAYER_SPECIALIZATION_CHANGED still fires for everything that we cared about.]==],
[==[]==],
[==[===v6.2.6===]==],
[==[====Bug Fixes====]==],
[==[* Added a hack to ElvUI's timer texts so that they will once again obey the setting in TellMeWhen. Previously, they would be enabled for all icons because of a change made by ElvUI's developers.]==],
[==[* Spell Cooldown icons that are tracking by spellID instead of by name should once again reflect spell charges properly (this functionality was disrupted by a bug introduced by Blizzard in patch 5.4).]==],

[==[]==],
[==[===v6.2.3===]==],
[==[* IMPORTANT: The color settings for all timer bars (including bar group and timer overlay bars) have changed a bit:]==],
[==[** The labels for these settings now correctly correspond to the state that they will be used for.]==],
[==[** The colors will automatically switch when you enable the "Fill bar up" setting for a bar.]==],
[==[** These changes will probably require you to reconfigure some of your settings.]==],
[==[]==],
[==[* Icons in groups that use the Bar display method can now have their colors configured on a per-icon basis.]==],
[==[** You can copy colors between icons by right-click dragging one icon to another.]==],
[==[]==],
[==[* TellMeWhen now uses a coroutine-based update engine to help prevent the occasional "script ran too long" error.]==],
[==[** This version also includes an updated LibDogTag-3.0 and LibDogTag-Unit-3.0 that should no longer throw "script ran too long" errors.]==],

[==[* Incorporated LibDogTag-Stats-3.0 into TellMeWhen's various implementations of LibDogTag-3.0.]==],
[==[* The Mastery condition now uses GetMasteryEffect() instead of GetMastery(). The condition will now be comparable to the total percentage increase granted by mastery instead of the value that has to be multiplied by your spec's mastery coefficient (which is no longer shown in Blizzard's character sheet.)]==],
[==[* TMWOptDB now uses AceDB-3.0. One benefit of this is that the suggestion list will now always be locale-appropriate.]==],
[==[* The suggestion list for units is now much more useful.]==],
[==[* The suggestion list now has a warning in the tooltip when inserting spells that interfere with the names of equivalencies.]==],
[==[* The suggestion list now pops up a help message the first time it is shown.]==],

[==[]==],
[==[====Bug Fixes====]==],

[==[* The Ranged Attack Power condition should now always use the proper RAP value.]==],
[==[* Fixed some "You are not in a raid group" errors.]==],
